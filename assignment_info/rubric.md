## 15 points:

All of the above. Plus:

* The `article` and `section` background colors are as they should be in both files.

* Padding and alignment in both versions look very close to the shown examples. **Note:** The standards is "looks very close"; you don't need to have the exact same measurements, because you don't know what those are.

* The CSS `margin` and `padding` properties are used correctly and not in excess. That is, you use them where it makes sense, and you do not use them when they are not needed, or redundant.

* `box-sizing` is used correctly.

* All hexadecimal RGB codes are used correctly. No color keywords are used!

* All punctuation marks required in the CSS file are used correctly. Check your semicolons.

* The CSS is formatted neatly, with sensible indents and use of linespaces that make code easy to read.

* All text has **good contrast** against the background color, regardless of which element contains it. This includes the link pseudo classes. You can check contrast here: [Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

## ORIGINALITY

The code in your assignment is yours and yours only. Showing your code to any other student, or giving another student code to solve the problem, or any part of the problem, is sharing and 
a violation of the university's honor code. Asking for a solution in any online forum is a violation of the university's honor code. Copying code from another student, past or present, is a violation of the university's honor code. Allowing anyone else to write code for you is a violation of the university's honor code. You must do your own work, or **risk a failing grade for the entire course.** Penalties for academic dishonesty are spelled out in the syllabus for this course.
